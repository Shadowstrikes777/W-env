## Objectives

I made this so that your work environment or your C project is already set up
without having to work a lot.
This is minimalist but well organized at least that is the goal.

## how to use  ?

clone the project and configure it yourself
You have this ressource at disposition, the libft has headers but you can remove them to use it as it pleases you or you can also ignore.
